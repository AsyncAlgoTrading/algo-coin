# AlgoCoin
AlgoCoin is a python library for writing trading algorithms. It is designed using a combination of asyncio and callbacks to make writing cross-asset, cross-currency, and cross exchange algorithms for backtesting and live trading as simple as possible. 

# WARNING: With the major refactoring of [aat](https://github.com/asyncalgotrading/aat), this library is essentially defunct for now. AAT will build toward the entire feature set of AlgoCoin, and eventually this library will be rebooted as just a UI on top of existing AAT functionality and APIs.
